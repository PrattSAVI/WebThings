Displayed through maps, art, and storytelling, this exhibition aims to empower visitors with an understanding of their capacity to make lasting changes in their neighborhoods.
<br>
Data, images, and narratives about stewardship in this show are drawn from the Stewardship Mapping and Assessment Project an applied research project of the USDA Forest Service. STEW-MAP has been used in more than a dozen locations worldwide to inventory civic stewardship groups, map their turf, and visualize their social networks. Thousands of stewardship groups are searchable through online, publicly accessible maps–including many informal groups that do not have websites of their own. STEW-MAP databases and interactive maps allow land managers, community organizations, non-profits, and the public to see where environmental stewardship groups are working in a particular landscape of interest. This community organizing tool can be applied to strengthen capacity, promote engagement with on-the-ground projects, and build a more effective partnerships among stakeholders."	/WTOCNY/1.JPG	/WTOCNY/2.JPG	/WTOCNY/3.JPG	/WTOCNY/4.JPG	/WTOCNY/5.JPG	/WTOCNY/6.JPG	/WTOCNY/7.JPG	/WTOCNY/8.JPG

ELI is a living resource for the community: to educate, to advocate, and to build a better North Brooklyn.

ELI is a story-based map that shines light on the area’s industrial past, its toxic legacy, and community resilience, and an interactive map where users can dive more deeply into the data, observe connections between historical land use and today’s environmental data, and explore and identify points of interest, such as Brownfields or Superfund sites. Collaborate with your neighbors to organize at points of interest right on the map.  "	/ELI/1.JPG	/ELI/2.JPG	/ELI/3.JPG	/ELI/4.JPG	/ELI/5.JPG	/ELI/6.JPG

A full design system, extensive data visualizations and maps were created to clearly communicate the story to a wide audience. Multiple reports, pamplets and products have been created for different clients on the Hudson River and its surrounding since 2018."	/HEP/1.JPG	/HEP/2.JPG	/HEP/3.JPG	/HEP/4.JPG	/HEP/5.JPG	/HEP/6.JPG	/HEP/7.JPG

To respond to this emergency, SAVI started a project to map the full extent of this environmental disaster. Using multi-band satellite imagery and automated classification techniques, SAVI released web maps that were updated every three days. Twitter posts including photographs and videos of this phenomenon were coupled with large scale remote sensing observations to provide a local understanding of the day-to-day situation. The complex nature of the waterflow in the Marmara Sea creates difficult conditions for training machine learning algorithms, so an ongoing update procedure was adopted to ensure the correctness of the observations. Produced web maps were published by the Metropolitan Municipaltiy of Istanbul. Sea mucus has disappeared due to rising temperatures but is expected to be observed again in coming years."	/SEA_MUCUS/1.JPG	/SEA_MUCUS/2.JPG	/SEA_MUCUS/3.JPG

The dense geometry of the street network is intended to contrast with the fluid blues of the bathymetry to visually emphasize the organic nature and scale of the water body in the middle of this urban area. The guide is distributed by numerous waterfront and human-powered boating programs around the Hudson-Raritan Estuary, making it easier for residents and visitors to understand the opportnities they have to get out and onto the Estuary waters."	/PADDLING/1.JPG	/PADDLING/2.JPG	/PADDLING/3.JPG

The maps are using data retrieved from sahibinden.com (a website for classifieds, similar to Craigslist or Gumtree), yemeksepeti.com (a website for ordering food), iett.istanbul (Istanbul’s official public transportation website), Instagram, Trafi, Google Maps, tripadvisor.com. The common feature for these data sources is that their content is mainly provided by its users, in other words they are all volunteered geographic information. Mostly consisting of unorganised, unfiltered and uncategorised raw data; this pool is the ultimate collective subconscious of our society. It has the information on what people like doing where, when, how; how they travel; how they spend their free time; how they speak to each other; what their share of economy is; how they take what was created and transformed them."	/KADIKOY/1.JPG	/KADIKOY/2.JPG	/KADIKOY/3.JPG	/KADIKOY/4.JPG	/KADIKOY/5.JPG
