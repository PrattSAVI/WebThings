Displayed through maps, art, and storytelling, this exhibition aims to empower visitors with an understanding of their capacity to make lasting changes in their neighborhoods.\n\nData, images, and narratives about stewardship in this show are drawn from the Stewardship Mapping and Assessment Project an applied research project of the USDA Forest Service. STEW-MAP has been used in more than a dozen locations worldwide to inventory civic stewardship groups, map their turf, and visualize their social networks. Thousands of stewardship groups are searchable through online, publicly accessible maps' including many informal groups that do not have websites of their own. STEW-MAP databases and interactive maps allow land managers, community organizations, non-profits, and the public to see where environmental stewardship groups are working in a particular landscape of interest. This community organizing tool can be applied to strengthen capacity, promote engagement with on-the-ground projects, and build a more effective partnerships among stakeholders.","img1":"\/WTOCNY\/1.JPG","img2":"\/WTOCNY\/2.JPG","img3":"\/WTOCNY\/3.JPG","img4":"\/WTOCNY\/4.JPG","img5":"\/WTOCNY\/5.JPG","img6":"\/WTOCNY\/6.JPG","img7":"\/WTOCNY\/7.JPG","img8":"\/WTOCNY\/8.JPG","img9":null,"img10":null},{"code":3,"name":"ELI","link":"https:\/\/northbrooklynneighbors.org\/eli\/","subtitle":"Environmental Legacy & Improvements Project.","cover":"\/ELI\/COVER.JPG","year":"2020","team":"Can Sucuoglu, Case Wyse","client":"North Brooklyn Neighbors","roles":"Project management, data analysis and visualization","tools":"ArcGIS Story Maps","text":"Environmental Legacy & Improvements (ELI) is a project designed in partnership with North Brooklyn Neighbors to help Greenpoint and Williamsburg residents organize for a more just environment today and into the future.

To respond to this emergency, SAVI started a project to map the full extent of this environmental disaster. Using multi-band satellite imagery and automated classification techniques, SAVI released web maps that were updated every three days. Twitter posts including photographs and videos of this phenomenon were coupled with large scale remote sensing observations to provide a local understanding of the day-to-day situation. The complex nature of the waterflow in the Marmara Sea creates difficult conditions for training machine learning algorithms, so an ongoing update procedure was adopted to ensure the correctness of the observations. Produced web maps were published by the Metropolitan Municipaltiy of Istanbul. Sea mucus has disappeared due to rising temperatures but is expected to be observed again in coming years.","img1":"\/SEA_MUCUS\/1.JPG","img2":"\/SEA_MUCUS\/2.JPG","img3":"\/SEA_MUCUS\/3.JPG","img4":null,"img5":null,"img6":null,"img7":null,"img8":null,"img9":null,"img10":null},{"code":7,"name":"NYC Paddling Guide","link":"https:\/\/www.hudsonriver.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/HRF_HEP_PaddlingGuide_final_5-27-21.pdf","subtitle":"Print map for accessing the waters of Hudson River","cover":"\/PADDLING\/COVER.JPG","year":"2021","team":"Can Sucuoglu, Sara Eichner","client":"Hudson River Foundation, New York-New Jersey Harbor & Estuary Program","roles":"Geospatial analysis, data QA\/QC","tools":"QGIS, Adobe Suite, Python","text":"For the NY-NJ Harbor Estuary Program (HEP) and many of their Hudson Estuary partners, we designed and built a print map and guide for kayakers in the Hudson Estuary.
